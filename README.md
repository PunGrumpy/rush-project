## üìñ About Rush Project

The Rush Project is designed to help you set up a mini showcase site composed of 3 pages and to practice all the basics covered during this week.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Description

Your first page will serve as a summary with links to two CVs. This initial page must be responsive and aesthetically pleasing! We strongly recommend using a CSS framework like Bootstrap.
Each resume page must include:

- **Navigation Bar:** You must implement your own navigation bar with links to at least 3 sections of your resume for easy navigation. This navigation bar should remain fixed as you scroll through the page.
- **Three Sections:** Each resume must have 3 distinct sections.
  - **The first section:** Displaying basic information such as a photo, name, and job title.
  - **The second section:** Displaying professional experiences and skills.
  - **The last section:** Providing links for contacting the person.

You have the freedom to arrange the content as you see fit. We highly recommend using templates to assist you in this task.
